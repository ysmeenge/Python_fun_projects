    "The player aims to find the boats in minimal amount of steps. The player is asked to 'shoot' at cells in the grid by giving the coordinates, e.g. \"A2\". If a boat is hit, the computer returns \"YOU HIT MY BOAT!\" and lets the player know which boat was hit. If the player misses the computer returns \"You've MISSED!\". Then the computer shows the playing board. It denotes '.' for coordinates that aren't hit yet, \"X\" if a coordinate was targeted but didn't have a boat on it. And a letter (C, B, R, S, D), as shown in the breakets in the boat list above, if a coordinate that was hit had a boat on it.\n",
